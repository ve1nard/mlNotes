    "# Principal Component Analysis using Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of Machine Learning problems include an enormous amount of features for each sample point. This both drastically increases the training time and makes finding the reasonable solution infeasible (the curse of dimensionality). Thus, we woud love to devise a way of representing the original training set using smaller number of dimensions, which we can do using Singular Value Decomposition.\n",

    "### Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigendecomposition $A = V \\Lambda V^{-1}$ is only applicable to square matrices that have enough linearly independent eigenvectors. Even if the matrix is diagonalizable,  $V$ does not always have a nice property of orthogonality (it does so only if $A$ is symmetric). Singular Value Decomposition, on the other hand, is a much nicer decomposition technique applicable to all sorts of matrices that provides us with orthonormal bases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A$ be a real $m \\times n$ matrix of rank $r$. Write $I_r$ for the $r \\times r$ identity matrix. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of $A$ is a factorization:\n",

    "This is a definition of the \"reduced\" SVD, where a set $u_1, \\dots, u_r$ is an orthonormal basis for the column space of $A$, while $v_1, v_r$ is an orthonormal basis for the row space of $A$. We can extend it by using the remaining $n-r$ $v$'s and $m-r$ $u$'s that form the nullspace $N(A)$ and the left nullspace $N(A^T)$, respectively, to get the full SVD $A = U \\Sigma V^T$, where $\\Sigma$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix constructed from $\\Sigma_r$ by adding extra $m-r$ zero rows and $n-r$ zero columns. This decomposition can be rewritten as a sum of r rank-one matrices:\n",

Now, since $Av_i =\\sigma_i u_i$, we can find $u$'s as $u_i = \\frac{Av_i}{\\sigma_i}$. To finish the derivation, we need to show that $u$'s are also orthonormal:\n",
